    <h1>Mobile Viewport</h1>

    <p>In order to ensure that your webpage displays well on mobile devices, you can add this <em>meta tag</em> to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>This meta tag issues a special instruction to the browser, telling it to start out with the view at 100% scale. On desktop browsers this is the default, but on mobile browsers to make websites more usable in the absence of special instructions otherwise, the browser will scale the entire view to fit on the screen.</p>

    <p>Modern mobile websites don't tend to be very easy to use this way though, so it's better to start off with the view at 100% and build the site so that it can be used on any size of screen.</p>
